## day planner

It's a day planner "ported" into html/ javascript.
Uses html5 local caching so your schedule is saved on your computer. 

I used [makeApp.sh](https://www.lessannoyingcrm.com/blog/2010/08/149/Create+application+shortcuts+in+Google+Chrome+on+a+Mac)([gist](https://gist.github.com/demonbane/1065791)) to create a Mac Dock icon for it.
